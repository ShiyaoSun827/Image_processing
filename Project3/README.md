# Cutting-Edge Computational Photography and Image Processing

## Overview: Advanced Computational Imaging and Transformations

This project demonstrates expertise in computational imaging and transformation techniques, leveraging advanced image processing, computer vision, and statistical analysis. It integrates powerful methodologies such as Bayer filter demosaicing, dithering, affine transformations, and feature-based image stitching. The implementation optimizes algorithms for efficiency, precision, and real-world applicability.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Bayer Filter Demosaicing
- Implement color reconstruction from raw Bayer pattern data.
- Utilize interpolation techniques to reconstruct missing color channels.
- Combine red, green, and blue components to generate a full-color image.

### 2. Floyd-Steinberg Dithering
- Apply Floyd-Steinberg dithering to an image to reduce color depth while preserving visual fidelity.
- Dynamically compute an optimized color palette using **KMeans clustering**.
- Implement error diffusion to balance pixel intensity adjustments across the image.

### 3. Geometric Transformations and Affine Mapping
- Implement image **rotation**, **scaling**, and **skewing** using mathematical transformation matrices.
- Compute **inverse transformations** to map pixels correctly without interpolation artifacts.
- Utilize **bilinear interpolation** to improve image quality in transformations.

### 4. Feature-Based Image Stitching
- Detect and extract image features using **ORB, SIFT, or SURF feature detectors**.
- Perform **feature matching** using nearest neighbor searches and descriptor comparison.
- Compute a **homography matrix** via **RANSAC** to align images accurately.
- Merge images into a seamless panoramic composition.

## Execution

Run the script with:
```bash
python main1.py
```
```bash
python main2.py
```
```bash
python main3.py
```
```bash
python main4.py
```
This will execute all computational photography techniques sequentially, displaying results for analysis.
