# Advanced Image Classification and Object Detection with CNNs

## Overview: Deep Learning-Based Visual Recognition

This project implements a **state-of-the-art image classification and object detection system** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. It leverages modern deep learning techniques for feature extraction, classification, and localization of objects, demonstrating expertise in neural network design, optimization, and real-world deployment.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Architecture
- Define a **custom CNN architecture** for multi-class classification of NotMNIST-RGB images.
- Incorporate **convolutional layers, max-pooling, batch normalization, and dropout** for robust feature extraction and regularization.
- Utilize **PyTorch's nn.Module** to efficiently construct the model.

### 2. Training and Optimization
- Implement **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with momentum** for stable convergence.
- Use **cross-entropy loss** for multi-class classification.
- Employ **learning rate scheduling** to enhance generalization performance.
- Integrate **data augmentation** techniques to improve model robustness.

### 3. Sliding Window Object Detection
- Implement a **sliding window detector** that scans large images and classifies extracted patches.
- Use **softmax probability filtering** to identify high-confidence regions.
- Ensure **Intersection over Union (IoU) constraints** to refine localization.

### 4. Model Evaluation and Performance Metrics
- Measure **classification accuracy** on the NotMNIST-RGB dataset.
- Evaluate **object detection performance** based on accuracy and IoU.
- Utilize **TensorBoard** for monitoring training progress and model diagnostics.

### 5. Deployment and Inference
- Optimize the trained model for real-world deployment with **model checkpointing and inference speed enhancements**.
- Ensure efficient GPU utilization for large-scale inference tasks.

## Execution

Run the script with:
```bash
python A6_main.py
```
This will train and evaluate the CNN on both classification and object detection tasks.

## Applications and Use Cases
